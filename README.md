# Random Forest Model for Predictive Analysis
This project implements a Random Forest classifier to predict a specified target variable based on a dataset of features. The goal is to leverage the Random Forest algorithm, optimize hyperparameters using Optuna, evaluate the model's performance, and gain insights into feature importance.

# Project Overview
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. This project covers:

Data preparation and exploration
Feature engineering
Model training and hyperparameter tuning with Optuna
Performance evaluation
Feature importance analysis

# Requirements
This project uses Python and the following libraries:

pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing
numpy: Numerical operations
scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and tools
matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization
optuna: Hyperparameter optimization
Install dependencies using:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn optuna
# Dataset
The dataset contains features related to [specify your dataset's context, e.g., "medical patient data," "customer demographics," or "sensor readings"]. Ensure the target variable and relevant feature columns are accurately set in the dataset.

Target Variable: [Specify the target variable, e.g., "disease diagnosis," "customer churn," or "equipment failure"]
Features: [List key features if desired]
To load the dataset, place it in the data folder or specify the path in the code.

# Usage
### Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Nigoraa1/RandomForestModel_to_predict.git
cd RandomForestModel_to_predict
### Step 2: Run the Model Training Script
Execute the script train_model.py to train the Random Forest model and save the results. Optuna will be used to find the best hyperparameters.

python train_model.py
### Step 3: Evaluate the Model
The results, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance, will be displayed and saved. Optuna's best hyperparameters are logged and applied to the model automatically.

# Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset files.
train_model.py: Main script to train the Random Forest model.
optuna_search.py: Uses Optuna to find the best hyperparameters for the Random Forest model.
evaluation.py: Functions to evaluate the model and visualize results.
README.md: Documentation of the project.
# Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna
The project uses Optuna to automate hyperparameter tuning. Optuna performs an efficient search for optimal values for parameters, such as:

n_estimators: Number of trees in the forest
max_depth: Maximum depth of the trees
min_samples_split: Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node
min_samples_leaf: Minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node
The tuning process is managed in the optuna_search.py script, which runs a defined number of trials to optimize the model’s performance based on accuracy or any other metric specified.

To adjust the number of trials or optimize other parameters, modify the optuna_search.py file.

# Model Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated based on:

Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
Confusion Matrix: Detailed breakdown of true and false predictions.
Feature Importance: Ranking of features based on their contribution to the model.
