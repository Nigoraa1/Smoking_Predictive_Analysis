# Overview
This project demonstrates how to develop a predictive model using the Random Forest algorithm, a popular ensemble technique known for high accuracy and versatility. The model will be trained to predict outcomes based on labeled datasets.

# Data Description
The project uses two datasets:

Training Data: train.csv - for building and tuning the model
Test Data: test.csv - for evaluating model performance
Target Variable: Specify the variable you wish to predict in the configuration or script. Ensure the datasets are properly preprocessed for best results.

# Prerequisites
Required Python libraries:

Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib (for optional visualizations)

# Setup
## Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Nigoraa1/RandomForestModel_to_predict.git
cd RandomForestModel_to_predict

## Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# How to Use
Data Preparation: Place train.csv and test.csv in the designated directory. Modify paths in the code as needed.

# Model Training: Run train_model.py to train the Random Forest model on the training dataset.
python train_model.py
Model Evaluation: Use the test dataset to assess model performance.

# Sample Command
Run the full workflow with:
python main.py --train_path "data/train.csv" --test_path "data/test.csv"

$$ Model Training & Evaluation
Key Random Forest hyperparameters include:

n_estimators: Number of trees in the forest
max_depth: Maximum depth of each tree
min_samples_split: Minimum samples needed to split a node
Tune these parameters to improve model accuracy.

# Performance Metrics
Model effectiveness is measured using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, offering insights into predictive reliability.

# Results
After evaluation, key performance metrics and any relevant visualizations will be displayed to help interpret model behavior and outcomes.
